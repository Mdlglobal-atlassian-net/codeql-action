# CodeQL Action

This action runs GitHub's industry-leading static analysis engine, CodeQL, against a repository's source code to find security vulnerabilities. It then automatically uploads the results to GitHub so they can be displayed in the repository's security tab. CodeQL runs an extensible set of [queries](https://github.com/github/codeql), which have been developed by the community and the [GitHub Security Lab](https://securitylab.github.com/) to find common vulnerabilities in your code.

Read about how to [enable code scanning](https://help.github.com/en/github/finding-security-vulnerabilities-and-errors-in-your-code/enabling-code-scanning) to start finding security vulnerabilities and errors in your code.
